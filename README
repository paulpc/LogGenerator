== LogGenerator

This projects attempts to create a small log generator that will eventually take a scenario fileas well as the network parameters (zones, ip ranges, type of servers) and will spit out log traffic for a log analysis appliance

As of *right now* the scenario is fixed in the main.rb file. It outputs the logs in the ./lib/output/ folder with different file names for each source. Whenever I put this together to facilitate a log analysis TableTopExercise, I wanted to focus on a few specific log sources including:
- Windows machines / servers (I think i modeled it after XP and 2003 servers)
- linux logs
- sendmail logs
- bluecoat web proxy logs
- apache web logs
- firewall logs that may look like juniper logs.

The current default scenario looks something like:
1. generating some random bening traffic on the firewall and web proxy
2. generating the servers (a mail server, a linux servers, 2 apache servers)
3. generating some random and bening logs from the windows hosts
4. starting some reconnesaince events with a port scan
5. continuing with some web app scanning
6. an email comes from a vendor
7. an admin logs in the firewall and sets up some bad rules
8. vendor will try to log into the server. At the same time, the servers are getting attacked
9. ssh bruteforce happens on the vendor account
10. evil is brewing on the compromised server, and starts spreading

Part of the materials I gave out in the TTX was a mind map of the services / users / hosts before the compromise, and one after the compromise (those should be automatically generated (though maybe in an old version of FreeMind) and placed in ./lib/output/mm/
