We know the game and we're gonna play it 
Inside we both know what's been going on 
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it 
We've known each other for so long 
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you 
Never gonna say goodbye, 
Never gonna make you cry, 
Never gonna run around and desert you, 
Never gonna let you down, 
Authentication: Repeated Login Failures, Single Host	Detected a source IP address causing an authentication failure event at least seven times to a single destination within 5 minutes. 
Never gonna give you up, 
Gotta make you understand 
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling 
You wouldn't get this from any other guy 
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of 
You know the rules and so do I 
We're no strangers to love
